     * find addresses of the Program Header Table and Section Header Table.
     * Afterwards, the ELF Header info is disposed of other than 
     * information such as the code entry point and the executable's 
     * endianness.
     * 
     * The Program Header Table is the most useful to us since it holds 
     * Program Headers which tell us the location of the .text (aka Code) 
     * segment, Data (initialized variables, etc) segment, and .bss 
     * segment (uninitialized variables).
     *
     * The Section Header Table is probably less useful, since it is 
     * typically only during linking and compiling.
     * 
     * Side note about endianness:
     * In normal situations, the ELF file is the same endianness as the 
     * target machine.
     * ARM specifications store instructions as little endian, but device 
     * memory may be either. (The LPC1768 is little endian)
